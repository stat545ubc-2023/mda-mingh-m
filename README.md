# How to engage with the files

For anyone who would like to replicate this project, please use the **mini-project-1.Rmd** file. Open it with Rstudio and load the required packages, such as **devtools** and **tidyverse**. To gain access to the datasets that was explored in this project, use this command *devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/datateachr")* to install the **datateachr** package.

To engage with **mini-project-2.Rmd** file, you also need to install and load **readr** and **here** packages.

After preparing all the packages, you just need to click the **Run** button on the top right corner of each code chunk to execute the code.
